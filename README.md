##About

I wish that everytime I looked at code, I would not have to re-adjust my eyes from the color theme in php storm to a 
bright white screen in Github. Now I don't have to.

This is a chrome extension you can set up locally. 

Clone this project, go to chrome extensions, enable developer mode, and upload the project. The URL in manifest.json is 
for github only, so you can modify it if you like for other sites, or keep altering the stylesheet.
