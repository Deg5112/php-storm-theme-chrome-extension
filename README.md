##About

This is a chrome extension you can set up locally. 

I found a darkula theme for github from 'StyishThemes, used apple idropper on phpstorm to get the theme color, altered the darkula theme 
stylesheet to mirror phpstorm. This is a work in progress but good enough to use.

Clone this project, go to chrome extensions, enable developer mode, and upload the project. The URL in manifest.json is 
for github only, so you can modify it if you like for other sites, or keep altering the stylesheet.
